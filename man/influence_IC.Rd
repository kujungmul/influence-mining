influence_IC(graph, seed, steps, prob)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{is the igraph object}

\item{seed}{is the initial seed nodes passed}

\item{steps}{is the time steps for which, the diffusion process should run. If exhaustive run is required, provide a high value (like 100). Default value is 1}

\item{prob}{is the probability of activation of a neighbour node. This is applicable only to IC model currently}
